Making mars a feasable proposition is tricky.

What do we mean by feasable?

 * We should be as self-sufficient as possible

 * We should be able to have enough economic leverage on earth
to trade, and to otherwise protect our interestes.

 * We should avoid making the same cultural-economic-political mistakes
as past countries.

#A word about this author, and his biases.

I am strongly tied to open source culture. I think that software is a one of the
areas that are most prone to natural monopoly, and it's only by making pretty
much everything open source that we can limit a given firms market power enough
that competitors can be *competitive*.

I also think that making cultural artifacts, tv shows, movies, video games,
freely availble is one of the best ways to take care of the disadvantaged in
your society.

This goes triple for books text books, and other learning resources.

I think in the near future it's going to be important to treat technical
drawings, PCB-layouts, and mechanical design the same way.

Simply put, I'm a dirty info-hippie who thinks we need to find a way to
encourage the creation of new intellectual-property without selling individual
units. I think we need to make "all information is free" a founding tenent of
our society.

If you disagree you can ignore those parts of the document. But I want to be
upfront about that bias so you don't dismiss the whole thing out of hand.

#Advantages

We're an entirely new nation unecombered by the laws, culteral norms, etc of the
old.

Building on that, we can rely more heavily on nuclear power.

There should be low-hanging easy-to-mine sources of metals.

#Economic output.

Having a strong local economy (be it a managed economy or some form of
capitalism) is important for mere survival, but in the medium-term having some
for of economic output is essential for having our interestes represented on
earth.

Shipping across intersteller distances is entirely untenable. Mars needs to have
a manufacturing economy internally, but we can't ship finished products. This
presents an obvious conundrum.

We should be able to export intellectual property, but without some force
multiplier I doubt we'll be able to compete with the N billion people on earth.

Personally, I believe that adherence to open-source could be that force
multiplier.


#Internal economy

The traditional economy has done very well using economics of scale. One highly
specialized machine that can produce 80% of the worlds need for zipper pulls.

That's... going to work less well in the early days. We need a core of
generalist machines, and plans for how to build more specialized machines from
that.

I geuss the big question is, what's the minimum requirements for our tools to be
truly self-replicating?

The hardest, by far, is computer control. It requires a complicated supply chain
and specilized tooling.
