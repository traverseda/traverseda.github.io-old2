<p>Making mars a feasable proposition is tricky.</p>
<p>What do we mean by feasable?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We should be as self-sufficient as possible</p>
</li>
<li><p>We should be able to have enough economic leverage on earth
to trade, and to otherwise protect our interestes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We should avoid making the same cultural-economic-political mistakes
as past countries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>A word about this author, and his biases.</h1>
<p>I am strongly tied to open source culture. I think that software is a one of the
areas that are most prone to natural monopoly, and it's only by making pretty
much everything open source that we can limit a given firms market power enough
that competitors can be <em>competitive</em>.</p>
<p>I also think that making cultural artifacts, tv shows, movies, video games,
freely availble is one of the best ways to take care of the disadvantaged in
your society.</p>
<p>This goes triple for books text books, and other learning resources.</p>
<p>I think in the near future it's going to be important to treat technical
drawings, PCB-layouts, and mechanical design the same way.</p>
<p>Simply put, I'm a dirty info-hippie who thinks we need to find a way to
encourage the creation of new intellectual-property without selling individual
units. I think we need to make "all information is free" a founding tenent of
our society.</p>
<p>If you disagree you can ignore those parts of the document. But I want to be
upfront about that bias so you don't dismiss the whole thing out of hand.</p>
<h1>Advantages</h1>
<p>We're an entirely new nation unecombered by the laws, culteral norms, etc of the
old.</p>
<p>Building on that, we can rely more heavily on nuclear power.</p>
<p>There should be low-hanging easy-to-mine sources of metals.</p>
<h1>Economic output.</h1>
<p>Having a strong local economy (be it a managed economy or some form of
capitalism) is important for mere survival, but in the medium-term having some
for of economic output is essential for having our interestes represented on
earth.</p>
<p>Shipping across intersteller distances is entirely untenable. Mars needs to have
a manufacturing economy internally, but we can't ship finished products. This
presents an obvious conundrum.</p>
<p>We should be able to export intellectual property, but without some force
multiplier I doubt we'll be able to compete with the N billion people on earth.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that adherence to open-source could be that force
multiplier.</p>
<h1>Internal economy</h1>
<p>The traditional economy has done very well using economics of scale. One highly
specialized machine that can produce 80% of the worlds need for zipper pulls.</p>
<p>That's... going to work less well in the early days. We need a core of
generalist machines, and plans for how to build more specialized machines from
that.</p>
<p>I geuss the big question is, what's the minimum requirements for our tools to be
truly self-replicating?</p>
<p>The hardest, by far, is computer control. It requires a complicated supply chain
and specilized tooling.</p>
