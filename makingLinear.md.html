<h1>Engineering Linearity</h1>
<h2>Preventing "a photo-copy of a photo-copy of a photo-copy" in self-replicating machines.</h2>
<p>One of the goals of the reprap community is to get self-replicating machines.
This workds pretty alright for the most part. It's more expensive then just
buying the parts, and obviously it only works for the plastic components, not
the hot-end or motors or control board. But on the whole it's an alright first
step.</p>
<p>The big problem is the "photo-copy of a photo-copy of a photo-copy" effect. If
you print a 3D printer on a 3D printer, it's slightly less accurate. And so on
and so on. This keeps us from true self-replication.</p>
<p>A rack and pinion system printed using a 3D printed rack and pinion system is
going to be less accurate then the original. After so many copies,
you've run out of lineararity.</p>
<p>Repraps get around this using various "vitamens". Using cold-rolled steal bars
instead of 3D printed parts, and getting their linearity from those handfull of
"known good" components.</p>
<p>But we have another source of pre-engineard linearity. The clocks on
microcontrollers provide a <em>high</em> degree of linearity in the 4th dimension,
time.</p>
